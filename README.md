# Simon-Game
To play this game, you need to start by pressing any key and observe the color that blinks. Then, you have to click on that color, followed by all the previous colors that have already blinked. For example, if a red color blinks first, you click on red. In the next level, if a yellow color blinks, you have to click on red and then on yellow, and so on.
